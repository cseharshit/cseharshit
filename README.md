### A Formal Introduction about me in case you're judging&nbsp;

## About Me

I am an insightful young individual trying to figure out what I'm doing here. 😄
I am very enthusisatic about the new developing tech and I crave to learn them. 
I believe that technology could bring peace to the world and my goal is to find a way a way to do that.
You could find more about me <a href=https://cseharshit.github.io>here</a>..
If I have to sell myself, these are my basic properties:

- 🇭 Hard-working. I'm a super lazy guy otherwise. But when I have work to do, I'd give all I have to finish it, so that  I could go back to being lazy again. xD

- 🅰️ Adaptable. Well, the best thing one can do is to adapt to change as quickly as possible, right? 

- 🇷 Realistic. Being realistic is really important to a software developer, especially when it comes to giving or accepting deadlines. I believe, it's better to be realistic about a project, then to commit something I can't achieve.

- 🇸 Shrewd. Savvy?

- 🇭 Humane. If I ain't human enough, I could not be anything. It's really important to me to be socially responsible.

- 🇮 Inquisitive. Would it hurt to know about this or that or everything? I wanna how things work.

- 🇹 Truthful. You can't grow further without being true to yourself.
