# About Me

I am an insightful young individual, although I haven't completely figured out what I'm doing here on Github. 😄<br>
I am very enthusisatic about the new developing tech and I crave to learn them.<br>
I believe that technology could bring peace to the world and my goal is to find a way to do that.<br> 
You could find more about me <a href=https://cseharshitjain.me/>here</a>..

If I have to sell myself, and I don't mean parts, these are my basic specifications:

- **H** Hard-working. I'm a super lazy guy otherwise, But when I have work to do, I'd give all I have to finish it, so that  I could go back to being lazy again. xD

- **A** Adaptable. Well, the best thing one can do is to adapt to change as quickly as possible, right? I usually just shout "PLOT TWIST" before accepting change, which by the way, is the only constant in life. 

- **R** Realistic. Being realistic is really important, especially as a software developer, more importantly when it comes to giving or accepting deadlines. I believe, it's better to be realistic in life, then to commit and grind myself for something I can't achieve.

- **S** Savvy. Not to bore the universe.

- **H** Humane. It's really important for us to be more than human, to be humane, to be socially responsible, to have compassion for other beings. Otherwise what is the purpose of doing anything at all?

- **I** Inquisitive. Would it hurt to know about this or that or everything? I wanna how things work.

- **T** Tenacious. For less extraordinary people like me, Persistence is the only key to achieve extraordinary things. ( I learnt that from Naruto 😄)
